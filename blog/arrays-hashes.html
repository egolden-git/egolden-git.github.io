<h1>Arrays vs. Hashes</h1>
<h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
<p>
  In today's discussion, I will discuss the difference between arrays and hashes in Ruby programming.  While they are quite similar, there are major differences between the two.
    </p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Array - An array is an ordered grouping of values which are assigned to variables.  This grouping of values is indexed and each value can be iterated through using a method.</li></p>
    <p>An example of an array would be: An array of numbers - ~>numbers = [1,2,3,4] </p>
    <li>Hash - A hash is an unordered group of values which are also assigned to variables.  Unlike an array, hashes are not indexed, rather values are matched to keys.</li></p>
    <p>An example of a hash would be: Personal Information - ~>users = {first_name: "given", last_name: "surname"}</p>
   </ul></p>
