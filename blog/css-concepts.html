<h1>CSS Classes vs. IDs</h1>
    <h3>Brief Introduction</h3>
      <p>
      CSS is a tool used to describe how HTML elements will be displayed on a web page.  2 components used in CSS to help standardize the formatting are: Classes and IDs.  While both items are very similar, there are different use cases for each.</p>
      <p>In simple terms; class is used to style multiple elements with the same formatting while and ID is used to style a single element.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Class<p> - A class is used to style mutiple elements within an HTML document with like parameters.  These parameters are know as Properties and can include but are not limited to font, color and size.  Since a class can be used on multiple elements throughout the HTML document, a single class could be used multiple times within the same document.  An example of using a class would be section headings.  In a CSS file, a class is defined by prepending a '.' in front of the class name.</li>
        <li>ID<p> - In contrast, an ID is used to style a single element within an HTML document.  The Properties for an ID are the same as a class but unlike a class, each ID in a single HTML document must be unique.  In a CSS file, an ID is defined by prepending a '#' in front of the ID name.</p></li>
      </ul>
