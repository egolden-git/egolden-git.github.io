<h2> Git and Github</h2>
<p>
      Git is a popular VCS that is used by quite a few developers, and is very useful for open source projects.  Git is software we download on our computers that allows us to make “save points” for our project.  It also allows copies to be made so that others can modify the project too.  Then they can all be merged into a whole.  To make this easier it is a good idea to use a someone else to host the project.  And that is where GitHub comes in.

      That in a very broad way is what I learned in camp this week.  Plus the code to make it work, and quite a bit about being a responsible programmer.  Thanks for your time.
