      Git and Github are developer tools used to track and control changes to source code created by multiple users at the same time.  Git is software installed on a local machine which handles version control of copied files from a master repository.  Github is a public repository of projects which files are maintained and shared with multiple users.  The repositories can be cloned to local machines which enables users to make changes to files without effecting other users also working on the same project.
      Git helps keep track of changes by implementing change controls on all files copied to local machines.  There is a defined process to checkout, modify and check back in files to the master repository.
